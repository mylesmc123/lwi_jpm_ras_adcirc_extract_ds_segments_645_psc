Convert ADCIRC fort.63 output data to a spatially averaged timeseries for each RAS Downstream Bondary Condition Segment in the format of DSS.

Develop Coordinate Points list from RAS Model geometry using 4326 projection for each segment.
	Export Geometry from RAS Mapper to .shp
	Edit shp via qgis to re-project and produce point file via: 'Convert lines to Points'.
	add coordinates to dbf, extract as csv.
	use script: "C:\py\louisiana_real_time_forecasting\src\system\scripts\dev\RAS_BCPointsCSV_to_PointFiles.ipynb" to develop each point file.


Get coldstart from fort.63 file.
	units attr on time var.

Loop through extractor for each point file.
