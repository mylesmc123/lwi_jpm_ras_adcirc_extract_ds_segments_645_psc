# lwi_jpm_ras_adcirc_extract_ds_segments_645_psc

The purpose of the repo is to provide a minimal example for extracting data from fort.63.nc ADCIRC output WSE data files directly to an HEC-RAS plan HDF file that can be used to run HEC-RAS directly and automatedly on Linux.

This particular application has an included sim_number argument for specifying multiple ensemple traces from ADCIRC output data, specifically for JPM_OS LWI usage.

The example is missing the fort.63 and ras hdf file required and specified in the example .vscode/launch.json command-line configuration file. Please contact me directly for this data, if needed.
